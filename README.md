<h2>To run:</h2>
Everything required to run this project is in this repository. To make it your own, just fork and clone this repository, then edit the index file to make whatever changes you'd like. 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
I would like to return to this file at a later date to further customize the styling of the map, and possibly pick a different city and/or update the information to more recent crime statistics. 
 
<h2>Support:</h2>
