# Hanoi-Tower
This is a recreation of the Hanoi-Tower mathmatical puzzle. It will default to 5 peices when you press the Make Move button, or you can enter a number in the input field to select however many disks you would like to play with. Then, one disk will be moved each time you press the button. Keep in mind, the more disks you start with, the longer it takes to finish. If you were to put 64 disks, it would take BILLIONS of years to complete (so... don't do that :wink:).

<h2>To run:</h2>
Everything required to run this project is in this repository. To make it your own, just fork and clone this repository and make whatever changes you desire.

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
I would like to return to this file at a later date to customize the alert. I realize I may have to change the code for it entirely since the alert is currectly not affected by CSS styling. I will be coming back later on to play around with that.
